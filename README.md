An experimental design and support code for an augmented-reality application that automatically retrieves input camera images of set-theoretic propositions and analyzes the observed set theory for set-theoretic contradictions.

To learn about the design of the application, read Set-Theoretical Contradiction Analysis.pdf.

Disclaimer: Extremely incomplete prototype. Computer vision model (prev. AlexNet) deprecated and to be replaced with newer machine learning infrastructure. Archived the tools here for future reference!
