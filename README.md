# stca
An experimental design and support code for an augmented-reality application that automatically retrieves input camera images of set-theoretic propositions and analyzes the observed set theory for set-theoretic contradictions.

To learn about the design of the application, [read this](https://github.com/cspades/stca/blob/aaa77dea96cd37ba90cb156aaea0f0bbcb4ba571/Set-Theoretical%20Contradiction%20Analysis.pdf).

Disclaimer: Extremely incomplete prototype. Computer vision model (prev. AlexNet) deprecated and to be replaced with newer machine learning infrastructure. Archived the tools here for future reference!
